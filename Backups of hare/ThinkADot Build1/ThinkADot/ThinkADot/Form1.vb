'Description:   This project creates a virtual Think-a-Dot machine. In the original
'               machine, eight windows would alternately display a yellow dot or a
'               blue dot each time a marble passed through its underlying flipper. 
'               The placement of these flippers looked like this:

'
'               If the dot had been yellow, the marble would drop down and to the left;
'               if the dot had been blue, the marble would drop down and to the right. 
'               Each time a marble dropped, two or three flippers would change color.
'
'               Flipper is a new control that can be dragged on to the design view of ThinkaDot
'               Review Flipper.vb for properties and methods useful in coding ThinkaDot
